# metal ðŸ¤˜
***metal*** is a  ***meta***programming ***l***anguage for .NET.

## what is *meta*programming?
Metaprogramming allows you to develop applications that can read, generate,  analyze, or transform other applications, and even modify themselves at runtime.

## what can *metal* do?
***metal*** is available through a CLI and the language engine is available as a NuGet package. 

The CLI contains a built-in [REPL interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) and can run ***metalscripts***. ðŸ¤˜

## metalscripts? lol
Those are files containing metal source code whose names end with a *.metal* extension). Clever right?

## syntax
The syntax is inspired by Ruby (my favorite language).

## use cases
TBD. I wanted something that would augment the runtime "experience" of .NET applications without writing CLR supported code. This could be in the form of AOP "pointcuts" (maybe through attributes?) or even a DSL.
